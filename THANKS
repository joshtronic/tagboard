No one has really contributed to the coding portion of this project, but a 
couple of people are worth mentioning.

  ME!  <josh@bombthebox.com> Who else would waste this much time on a project so
                             mediocre in size?

  Dean <dean@geekoid.org>    All around good coder, and is always making 
                             suggestions, even when they aren't asked for.
 
  Matt <sirmalloc@gmx.net>   Not sure if he has a personal vendetta against me, 
                             or if he is starving for my attention, but this guy
                             keeps breaking my code and finding holes in it. 
                             Hopefully mentioning him here will get him to move 
                             on to bigger and better things.

If your name wasn't mentioned, then you mustn't be that important!
