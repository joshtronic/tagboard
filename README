Before the tag board will function, we have to do a few things...

  1. Make sure you have PHP on your server, if not, it won't work

  2. Unpack the .ZIP file to a directory on your server (/tagboard will be fine)

  3. a. If you decide to use a text file, then make sure you change the 
        permissions on the file to 666 (chmod 666 tagboard)

     b. If you are going to use a MySQL database, you will need to create your 
        database for the script to work off of:

          create table tagboard
            (
              id int(10) not null auto_increment,
              nick varchar(16) not null,
              url varchar(128) not null,
              message varchar(128) not null,
              datetime varchar(255) not null,
              ip varchar(15) not null,
              primary key(id)
            );

  4. Edit required.php to reflect your  set up, along with the other 
     customizations

  5. Enjoy your new tag board!

CHEERS!
