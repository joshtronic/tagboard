April 16, 2002 - version 0.6.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Finally eliminated any exploits that allow someone to execute arbitrary code
  (I think).  Also added an "email detect" that will detect if the user was a
  dummy and put in their email address instead of a URL, and add "mailto: to the
  front of it.

April 15, 2002 - version 0.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Recoded the majority of the script.  Optimized the code for speed and to fit 
  cleancode.org's coding standards.  Also added timestamping.

March 26, 2002 - version 0.5.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fixed a security bug that allowed for a user to execute JavaScript from the
  URL field.

March 14, 2002 - version 0.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fixed some problems with the code I optimized that killed the ability to use a
  MySQL database.  This version works with both the flat file, or MySQL, hence 
  the jump in version number.  Also added a couple more variables to customize
  the email that is sent when someone posts (if you have that option enabled).

February 25, 2002 - version 0.4.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fixed an error that occured when the 'notify by email' option was enabled.

February 23, 2002 - version 0.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Compatibility issues with Mozilla, Netscape and older version of IE have been
  resolved.  The error messages are now customizable from within the 
  'required.php' file, and the index page for the tag board is generated 
  dynamically with the version number, set the max length of each field, and 
  will post a link for emoticon help if emoticons are enabled.  Quite a bit of 
  the code has been optimized.  The big feature is the ability to choose either
  using a MySQL database, or a flat file (./tagboard.dat).  The new flat file 
  has to have the correct permissions to run correctly (chmod 666), and runs in
  the same fashion as the MySQL version does.  The only limitation to the flat
  file is that it posts the entire contents of the file, and doesn't allow you
  to choose the order (yet).

February 17, 2002 - version 0.3.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fixed the problem where the tag board wouldn't refresh itself after a user
  posts a message.

February 15, 2002 - version 0.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fixed a security hole allowing the use of server-side includes, as well as 
  HTML comments, <!-- blah -->.

February 14, 2002 - version 0.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tweaked out some code, and added emoticons.

January 31, 2002 - version 0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Added the ability to limit the length of words (to prevent postings such as
  "wwwwwaaaaaassssssssuuuuupppppp!".  A global variable has been added to 
  determine what character will be used to seperate the name and the message, 
  for easy customization.  The flood protection is not optional, in case you 
  want to turn it off.  You can now specify the max length of the nick and the
  message.  Please note, if you go over the recommended max, without updating 
  the database, then your messages will be cut off.  The final update is the
  addition of an HTML filter, to prohibit people from posting HTML to the tag
  board, this will keep the kids from posting <H1> text, and screwing everything
  up.

January 28, 2002 - version 0.1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Added the option to display the posts in ascending or descending order, based
  on when it was posted.

December 13, 2001 - version 0.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  All cusomizable variables added to required.php for easy cusomization.  Better 
  flood protection added by not letting the same IP post twice, and the addition 
  of an optional keyword (profanity) checker.

December 12, 2001 - version 0.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Initial release.
