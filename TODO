I would like to add in a way to use plugins, to make it easier for me to keep my
version and the version I release to the public in sync, and so that way you 
kids don't get to use some of my custom mods ;)

Eventually I want to add more dummy proof filters to the URL field, and give 
you the option to specify if they put in their URL, an email address, or either
one.
